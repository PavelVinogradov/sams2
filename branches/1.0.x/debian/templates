_Description: Vulnerable random number generator
 A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used by OpenSSL
 on Ubuntu and Debian systems.  As a result of this weakness, certain
 encryption keys are generated much more frequently than they should be, such
 that an attacker could guess the key through a brute-force attack given minimal
 knowledge of the system.
 .
 Any keys created on a vulnerable system may be affected by this problem. The
 'openssl-vulnkey' command may be used as a partial test for RSA keys with
 certain bit sizes, and the 'openvpn-vulnkey' for OpenVPN shared secret keys.
 Users are urged to verify their keys or simply regenerate any server or client
 certificates and keys in use on the system.
