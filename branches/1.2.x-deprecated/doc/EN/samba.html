<H2>Building, Installing and Configuring Samba</H2>
<P>If your Samba not support winbind, uninstall it.    Winbind is the Samba component that allows a 
linux box to act as a Windows machine in various ways.  You can download the latest Samba source from www.samba.org, 
but be aware that using and combining different versions of Samba and Squid may result in neither package working as expected.  
For this procedure, it is recommend to use exact version used here.  The version of Samba used in this procedure is 2.2.6-1.

 
<P><B>Building and Installing Samba</B>
<P>Samba needs to be compiled to include support for winbind.  To do so, compile it with the --with-winbind --with-winbind-auth-challenge options i.e.

<P>./configure --with-winbind --with-winbind-auth-challenge

<P>Next make the binaries for Samba using the make command... then make install.
 
<P><B>Configuring Samba</B>

<P>Copy the libnss_winbind.so file from source/nsswitch directory  to /lib.  Create a symlink for this file as follows: 
<BR>ln -s /lib/libnss_winbind.so /lib/libnss_winbind.so.2.

 <P>To link these newly created libraries, run the following command: 
 <BR>root#/sbin/ldconfig -v | grep winbind.

<P>Next, the /etc/nsswitch.conf file needs to be altered to include winbind support.  
Find the passwd, shadow, and group lines, and insert winbind as shown below:

<P>passwd:            files winbind nisplus
<BR>shadow:             files winbind nisplus
<BR>group:               files winbind nisplus
 
<P>Now, the smb.conf needs to be configured by adding a few lines to the Global Settings section.  
Copy the default RedHat smb.conf from the samba-2.2.6/packaging/RedHat directory to the /usr/local/samba/lib directory.  
Contrary to the Samba/Winbind documentation, for this procedure no winbind separator needs to be specified[2].  
The following lines can be added to the top of the Global Settings section.

 

<P>winbind cache time = 15
<BR>template shell = /bin/false  #or /bin/bash (only needed if ssh (or similar) access allowed for users)
<BR>winbind uid = 10000-20000
<BR>winbind gid = 10000-20000
<BR>winbind enum users = yes
<BR>winbind enum groups = yes

<P>The following options are already present in the smb.conf file, but need to be configured correctly.  Find these options and edit them accordingly.

<P>workgroup =             EXAMPLE
<BR>security = domain
<BR>password server = opmast.example.com
<BR>encrypt passwords = yes

<P>To ensure that the password server listed in the smb.conf file is accessible, add the following line to the /etc/hosts file.

<P>192.168.1.30            opmast.example.com            opmast

<P>In addition, it is important that the linux box is configured to use the DNS server which is the holds the PDC role in the 
Windows 2000 domain, which in this scenario is opmast.example.com (192.168.1.30), or another DC for this domain.  
It is preferable to set the dns server on the linux box to a windows DC within the same site for performance reasons.

<P>The machine now needs to be joined to the Windows2000 domain.  Use the following command to join to the domain:  
<BR>root#/usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd -j EXAMPLE -r OPMAST -U administrator 
(where administrator is a username of someone with access to join machines to the domain).  
<BR>If the join process was successful, a message will appear stating so.

<P>Start winbind and test it using the wbinfo tool found in /usr/local/samba i.e. /usr/local/samba/bin/wbinfo -u.  
If you see all domain users, winbind is operating correctly.  Note that with the default winbind separator, the syntax of the test 
for wbinfo -a is example\\username%password... you have to add an extra backslash.

<P>If problems are encountered at this point, the most commonly found issues that I've encountered have been related to 
security in Active Directory preventing the linux box from accessing group and account information, or name resolution related to DNS problems.
