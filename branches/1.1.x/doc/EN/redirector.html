 <H2>SQUID redirector settings</H2>

<P>Squid has the ability to rewrite requested URLs. Implemented as an external process (similar to a dnsserver), 
Squid can be configured to pass every incoming URL through a redirector process that returns either a new URL, 
or a blank line to indicate no change.
<BR>SAMS may be used a several redirectors, but SAMS doesn't insert redirector support to squid.conf. You must insert a support 
string for your redirector to squid.conf. 
<P>The SAMS may use next redirectors:
<LI> SQUID perl redirector
<LI> samsredir - the SAMS redirector
<LI> SquidGuard

<P><B>SQUID perl redirector</B>
<P>Description of this redirector is written of the SQUID documentation.
<BR>Insert next string of the squid.conf file:
<BR>redirect_program /etc/squid/redirect.sams

<P><B>SAMS redirector</B>
<P>This redirector is designed for SAMS and sends requests to the MySQL database.
This redirector can use different URL lists for different users. 
<BR>Insert next string of the squid.conf file:
<BR>redirect_program /usr/local/bin/samsredir

<P><B>Редиректор SquidGuard</B>
<BR>Insert next string of the squid.conf file:
<BR>redirect_program /путь/к/squidguard
